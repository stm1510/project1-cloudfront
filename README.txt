i would have created  a hosted domain with Route53 and created a record for the cloudformation distribution as the value but due to limited privilege for the user and secondly the cost 



This is my site url or ( cloudformation end point ): "https://d3pcd70eajee3f.cloudfront.net/index.html" 


I used the picture of the Real Madrid stadium estadio Bernabeu has my vacation picture that is background . I had the image from this link "https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp1837183.jpg"

I changed the Header to "Project 1 udacity by TAWFIQ"

Replaced The Next two Notes too with :

"The Most Popular Stadium for Solo Travelers is Estadio Bernabeu"

"This Site was created by Tawfiq to connect Travelers Who Are Looking for Someone to Travel and Split Expenses With"
